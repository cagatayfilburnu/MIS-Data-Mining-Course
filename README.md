## MIS-Data-Mining-Course

There are my Management Information System Department's course projects that I studied in MIS-Data Mining and Business Intelligence

attritionData_NaiveBayes_Project is about attrition data set. In the lecture, we did a Naive Bayes model and our project tast, how we can improve the our model. So, I did a elimination in the data. Secondly, I converted data to improve model results.
